  codedeploy:
1. create ec2 with IAM role that has s3 permissions since codedeploy will ask
ec2 to fetch the s3 artifact that was build by codebuild
2. install codedeploy agent on ec2
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-linux.html
3. add tags to ec2 for codeDeploy usage
4. create new codedeploy app
5. create deployment group next
6. create iam role for codedeploy and attach codedeploy policy
7. create deployment for the deployment group
8. create s3 bucket and upload your webapp files as zip file
9. start the deployment
10. open port 80 on ec2
11. check
12. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-example.html
13. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-structure-hooks.html#appspec-hooks-server
14. set up sns topic and subscribe your email
15. create event rule which will notify you when codeDeploy state change happens
16. rollback option discussion
17. onprem codedeploy: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/on-premises-instances-register.html
18. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/register-on-premises-instance-iam-user-arn.html
19. create ec2 with no iam role
20. create iam user with full s3 permissions and codedeploy full permissions
21. create onprem config file with iam user credentials
22. install codedeploy agent on onprem instance
23. register onprem instance with codedeploy
25. create new deployment for app
26. deploy your app based on Environment:Dev
27. codedeploy lambda: create app for lambda compute platform
28. create dep group
29. iam role: codedeploy for lambda
30. canary(shift traffic in 2 increments) vs linear
31. create 2 lambda versions, create alias for version 1
32. use appspec file for lambda
33. test lambda deployment with appspec yaml editor
34. codepipeline
35. create simple codepipeline without codebuild
36. add codebuild test option and test for grep "text here"
37. add manual step
38. add parallel stage to codedeploy and add s3 bucket
