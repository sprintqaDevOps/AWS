Create LAMP stack using the given CFN template. Check on resources to confirm needed infrastructure. 

Install Wordpress and create a sample post with an image. 

Use the given commands to transfer data from existing LAMB stack server to a dedicated Maria DB server. 

# use this command to get a snapshot of the existing maria db data
mysqldump -u root -p sprintqa > wordpressServer.sql

# use this command to remotely connect to private ip of dedicated maria db and send snapshot we persisted in the original wordpress db
mysql -h PrivateIP -u sprintqa -p sprintqa < wordpressServer.sql


Now, edit wordpress config to make it point to the new db. 
cd /var/www/html
vim wp-config.php	>	replace localhost for DB_HOST to private IP of dedicate MariaDB server
:wq!

Now, confirm Wordpress website is working by refreshing. 

Shut down Wordpress server MariaDB service to make sure that your website is still functioning since it is now connected to the dedicated MariaDB server. 
systemctl status mariadb
systemctl stop mariadb 

Part 2: migrate from dedicated MariaDB to AWS RDS

1. Create subnet group in the vpc created by cfn and select us-east-1a/b/c AZs.
 	Then select DB subnets for all 3 AZs
 	Create 
2. Create rds with free tier and mysql 5.7.31, for rds vpc connectivity select created vpc and subnet group. Select private option for access,
3. Make sure your rds sg has inbound rule from mariaDB instance sg. 
4. Run commands from part 1 to export .sql file to rds and confirm. 


Part 3: 
Create RDS with public access.
Install mysql shell/workbench.
Connect using cmd/terminal.
mysqlsh --user=admin --port=3306 --host dbName.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com  
	\sql
	use sprintqa (dbname)
	create table items (item_id int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, name varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (item_id)) ;
	select * from items;
	insert into items values('4545','Laptop');
	select * from items;
